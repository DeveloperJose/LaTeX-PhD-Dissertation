% \chapter{Related Work}
% % I'm still gathering papers and deciding which ones to add. For now,
% % \begin{itemize}
% %     \item Relation Networks for Few-Shot Learning as they extract embeddings that represent some "knowledge" of the data and can be multi-modal so combine images + text + audio + video, etc \cite{RelationNet}
% %     \item Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as they are directly related to the research
% %     \item There are some newer PINNs architectures but they are used for heat problems and other problems indirectly (or sometimes not at all) related to glacier ice problems
% % \end{itemize}
